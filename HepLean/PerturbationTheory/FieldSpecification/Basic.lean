# Field specification

In this module is the definition of a field specification.

-/

/-- A field specification is a type of fields plus a specification of the
  statistics (fermionic or bosonic) of each field. -/
structure FieldSpecification where
  /-- The type of fields. This also includes anti-states. -/
  Fields : Type
  /-- The specification if a field is bosonic or fermionic. -/
  statistics : Fields → FieldStatistic

namespace FieldSpecification
variable (𝓕 : FieldSpecification)

/-- Negative asymptotic states are specified by a field and a momentum. -/
def AsymptoticNegTime : Type := 𝓕.Fields × Lorentz.Contr 4

/-- Positive asymptotic states are specified by a field and a momentum. -/
def AsymptoticPosTime : Type := 𝓕.Fields × Lorentz.Contr 4

/-- States specified by a field and a space-time position. -/
def PositionStates : Type := 𝓕.Fields × SpaceTime

/-- The combination of asymptotic states and position states. -/
inductive States (𝓕 : FieldSpecification) where
  | negAsymp : 𝓕.AsymptoticNegTime → 𝓕.States
  | position : 𝓕.PositionStates → 𝓕.States
  | posAsymp : 𝓕.AsymptoticPosTime → 𝓕.States

/-- Taking a state to its underlying field. -/
def statesToField : 𝓕.States → 𝓕.Fields
  | States.negAsymp φ => φ.1
  | States.position φ => φ.1
  | States.posAsymp φ => φ.1

/-- The statistics associated to a state. -/
def statesStatistic : 𝓕.States → FieldStatistic := 𝓕.statistics ∘ 𝓕.statesToField

/-- The field statistics associated with a state. -/
scoped[FieldSpecification] notation 𝓕 "|>ₛ" φ => statesStatistic 𝓕 φ

/-- The field statistics associated with a list states. -/
