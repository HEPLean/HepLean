For a list `φs` of `𝓕.FieldOp`, the static version of Wick's theorem states that

`φs =∑ φsΛ, φsΛ.staticWickTerm`

where the sum is over all Wick contraction `φsΛ`.

The proof is via induction on `φs`.
- The base case `φs = []` is handled by `staticWickTerm_empty_nil`.

The inductive step works as follows:

For the LHS:
1. The proof considers `φ₀…φₙ` as `φ₀(φ₁…φₙ)` and use the induction hypothesis on `φ₁…φₙ`.
2. This gives terms of the form  `φ * φsΛ.staticWickTerm` on which
  `mul_staticWickTerm_eq_sum` is used where `φsΛ` is a Wick contraction of `φ₁…φₙ`,
  to rewrite terms as a sum over optional uncontracted elements of `φsΛ`

On the LHS we now have a sum over Wick contractions `φsΛ` of `φ₁…φₙ` (from 1) and optional
uncontracted elements of `φsΛ` (from 2)

For the RHS:
1. The sum over Wick contractions of `φ₀…φₙ` on the RHS
  is split via `insertLift_sum` into a sum over Wick contractions `φsΛ` of `φ₁…φₙ` and
  sum over optional uncontracted elements of `φsΛ`.

Both side now are sums over the same thing and their terms equate by the nature of the
lemmas used.
