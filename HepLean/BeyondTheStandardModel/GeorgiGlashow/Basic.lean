# The Georgi-Glashow Model

The Georgi-Glashow model is a grand unified theory that unifies the Standard Model gauge group into
`SU(5)`.

This file currently contains informal-results about the Georgi-Glashow group.

namespace GeorgiGlashow

/-- The gauge group of the Georgi-Glashow model, i.e., `SU(5)`. -/
informal_definition GaugeGroupI where
  deps := []

/-- The homomorphism of the Standard Model gauge group into the Georgi-Glashow gauge group, i.e.,
the group homomorphism `SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) → SU(5)` taking `(h, g, α)` to
`blockdiag (α ^ 3 g, α ^ (-2) h)`.

/-- The kernel of the map `inclSM` is equal to the subgroup `StandardModel.gaugeGroupℤ₆SubGroup`.
